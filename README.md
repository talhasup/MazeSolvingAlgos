In this project, I implemented A*, BFS, DFS, DLS, and IDS to navigate a dynamic 40x40 maze. 
Each algorithm attempts to find a solution, but the maze's dynamic nature adds complexity: new obstacles are introduced every 10 moves, and old ones are removed after 15 moves. 
This constantly changing environment means that the algorithms may or may not successfully find a path to the goal, showcasing the challenges of real-time problem-solving in maze navigation.
